# C-Coding-Resources

Notes and resources I've written up while learning C; I wrote these as reminders, but uploading them may be of use to others. All of these are written primarily in Markdown, with snippets of code examples and links to other places in my Github Library to remind me.

A shoutout to my friends at 42Adelaide (particularly Byron) for getting me to start doing this in week 1 of the Piscine.

My brain's ability to retain information is hit-and-miss, so keeping a folder of resources has really helped me as I approach more significant exams here in school.
